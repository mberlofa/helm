# Security and Trust

## When to use this guide

Read this guide when:

- the external database uses TLS
- Keycloak must trust internal or self-signed certificate authorities
- secret rotation is managed outside Helm
- the environment has stricter outbound TLS requirements

## Trust model in this chart

The chart separates two concerns:

- `database.tls` for database-specific TLS material and JDBC URL wiring
- `truststore` for additional trusted certificates used by Keycloak in outbound TLS connections

This keeps database CA handling explicit without pretending every outbound TLS integration is the same as database connectivity.

## Database TLS

The current automatic TLS wiring is production-ready for PostgreSQL.

Example:

```yaml
database:
  vendor: postgres
  host: postgresql-rw.default.svc
  name: keycloak
  username: keycloak
  existingSecret: keycloak-db
  tls:
    enabled: true
    sslMode: verify-full
    existingConfigMap: keycloak-db-ca
    rootCertFilename: ca.crt
```

What the chart does in this case:

- mounts the CA material under `database.tls.mountPath`
- appends PostgreSQL TLS parameters to the generated JDBC URL
- keeps database credentials in the existing database secret flow

If the environment uses MySQL or MariaDB, keep TLS expectations explicit and prefer additional JDBC parameters only after validating the exact driver behavior used in the target environment.

## Additional truststore material

Use `truststore` when Keycloak must trust internal or private certificate authorities for outbound TLS connections.

Example:

```yaml
truststore:
  enabled: true
  existingSecret: keycloak-extra-cas
  tlsHostnameVerifier: DEFAULT
```

This chart mounts the referenced files and exposes them through `KC_TRUSTSTORE_PATHS`.

Accepted formats follow the official Keycloak guidance:

- PEM certificates
- unencrypted PKCS12 files

## Hostname verification

The chart exposes `truststore.tlsHostnameVerifier`, which maps to Keycloak hostname verification for outbound TLS connections.

Recommended production behavior:

- keep `DEFAULT`
- do not use `ANY` in production

## Secret rotation guidance

Generated admin and database secrets are part of the Helm release and trigger a rollout through the deployment checksum when they change during an upgrade.

Externally managed secrets or ConfigMaps do not trigger an automatic rollout just because their content changed. When those inputs rotate, plan an explicit rollout or restart of the Keycloak deployment.

Examples:

- external secret controller rotates the database password
- the database CA bundle is replaced
- internal CA certificates are updated in the truststore

## Rollout checklist for trust changes

- confirm the new certificate chain is present in the referenced Secret or ConfigMap
- confirm the mounted filenames match the configured values
- trigger a controlled rollout after secret or truststore rotation
- validate database connectivity after rollout
- validate admin login and public login flows after rollout
