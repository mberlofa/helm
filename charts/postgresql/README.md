# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL for Kubernetes with explicit `standalone` and `replication` modes, documented bootstrap behavior, optional init scripts, and optional metrics.

## Install

### HTTPS repository

```bash
helm repo add helmforge https://repo.helmforge.dev
helm repo update
helm install postgresql helmforge/postgresql -f values.yaml
```

### OCI registry

```bash
helm install postgresql oci://ghcr.io/helmforgedev/helm/postgresql -f values.yaml
```

## Supported architectures

| Architecture | When to use | Document |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `standalone` | development, simple production environments, or workloads where a single writable database is acceptable | [docs/standalone.md](docs/standalone.md) |
| `replication` | one writable primary plus asynchronous read replicas for read scaling and simpler recovery workflows | [docs/replication.md](docs/replication.md) |

## What this chart covers

- explicit architecture selection through `architecture`
- PostgreSQL on the official `postgres` image
- generated or externally-managed passwords through `existingSecret`
- app user and app database bootstrap on first initialization
- optional extra init scripts
- fixed-primary asynchronous replication with `pg_basebackup`
- role-aware readiness checks for primary and replicas in replication mode
- optional metrics through `postgres_exporter`
- optional `ServiceMonitor`
- dedicated metrics Services separated from client traffic
- topology-specific Services for client traffic, primary traffic, and read replicas

## How to choose the architecture

- use `standalone` when operational simplicity matters more than read scaling
- use `replication` when you need separate write and read endpoints, but you are not asking the chart to solve automatic failover

- PostgreSQL official image: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres

## Operational direction

- for production needing automatic failover, use a PostgreSQL operator instead of stretching this chart beyond its scope
- `replication` in this chart means one fixed primary with asynchronous replicas
- backups remain an operational concern outside this chart and should be implemented with dedicated tooling

## Read traffic model

In `replication` mode, the chart exposes separate Services for different traffic patterns:

- the base client Service for general in-cluster access
- a dedicated primary Service for write traffic
- a dedicated replicas Service for read-only traffic

The replicas Service is the endpoint to use for horizontal read scaling when an application, reporting stack, or other read-heavy component can work against asynchronous read-only replicas.

Important limits:

- Kubernetes Service balancing distributes connections across available replicas, but it is not a PostgreSQL-aware query router
- replica reads may lag behind the primary because replication is asynchronous
- workloads that require immediate read-after-write consistency should stay on the primary endpoint

## Scope boundary

This chart intentionally stays on the Helm-chart side of the boundary:

- it manages PostgreSQL pods, services, storage, init scripts, metrics, TLS, and basic replication operations
- it does not attempt to behave like a cluster manager
- it does not implement automatic failover, leader election, fencing, or reconciliation loops

If you need automated failover, self-healing topology management, switchover workflows, or lifecycle orchestration across primary and replicas, use a PostgreSQL operator instead of extending this chart into that territory.

## Quick start

Minimal standalone example:

```yaml
architecture: standalone

auth:
  existingSecret: postgresql-auth

standalone:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    size: 20Gi
```

Replication example:

```yaml
architecture: replication

auth:
  existingSecret: postgresql-auth

replication:
  primary:
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      size: 50Gi
  readReplicas:
    replicaCount: 2
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      size: 50Gi

metrics:
  enabled: true
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
```

## Best practices

### Security

- prefer `auth.existingSecret` in production
- keep client access internal unless there is a strong reason to expose PostgreSQL outside the cluster network
- use `networkPolicy.enabled=true` or external platform controls when possible
- rotate passwords through secret management workflows instead of editing values inline
- use `tls.enabled=true` with certificate material from a managed secret when PostgreSQL traffic must be encrypted

### Replication and availability

- treat `replication` as read scaling and operational recovery help, not full HA
- place primary and replicas across different nodes or zones when the cluster supports it
- use `pdb.enabled=true` when running multiple replicas and planning maintenance windows
- review the default replication PDB and placement behavior before overriding them globally
- keep `startupProbe` conservative for PostgreSQL, especially on larger volumes and recovery paths

### Initialization

- use `initdb.scripts` for deterministic first-boot SQL or shell customization
- use `initdb.existingConfigMap` when scripts are already managed elsewhere
- remember that `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` runs only during first initialization of a fresh data directory

### Observability

- enable `metrics.enabled=true` in monitored environments
- enable `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true` when Prometheus Operator is available
- metrics are exposed through dedicated metrics Services, not through the client database Services
- monitor connection count, replication lag, disk growth, checkpoint behavior, and WAL retention

### Configuration UX

- use `config.preset` for a small set of opinionated PostgreSQL defaults
- use `config.pgHbaEntries` when you need structured host-based access rules
- use `*.resourcesPreset` for small and predictable environment sizing before reaching for fully custom resources
- keep `config.postgresql` and `config.pgHba` for raw overrides when structured values are not enough
- keep `auth.database`, `auth.username`, and `auth.replicationUsername` as plain values; `existingSecret` is intentionally limited to sensitive runtime data

## Production notes

- use `auth.existingSecret` instead of inline passwords
- keep persistence enabled for every stateful topology
- define node placement rules for `replication`, especially when the cluster spans multiple nodes or zones
- use the `client` or `primary` Service only for writes
- use the `replicas` Service only for read traffic
- use the `replicas` Service when you need horizontal scale for read-only workloads
- treat backup, restore, and failover as operational workflows external to the chart
- review the operational guides before promoting `replication` to production

## Examples

See `examples/`:

- `standalone.yaml`
- `replication.yaml`
- `initdb-metrics.yaml`
- `tls.yaml`

## Important notes

- `replication` here is asynchronous replication with one fixed writable primary
- this chart does not implement automatic primary election
- init scripts run only on first initialization of a fresh data directory
- for failover-oriented production operations, use an operator instead of trying to turn this chart into one
